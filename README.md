# EdTech Recorded Lectures Dashboard

## Project Summary

This project explores data collected from various EdTech platforms to help a growing startup make informed decisions about its recorded lecture offerings. The goal was to clean, analyze, and present the data through a clear and insightful Power BI dashboard. The company wants to understand what works best when it comes to recorded courses, which areas offer growth opportunities, and how learners engage with content.

All analysis and visuals in the dashboard focus heavily on course **categories**, as that is the central lens through which the business wants to understand the data.

## Problem Statement

An EdTech startup wants to expand its library of recorded lectures. They have collected data from multiple online learning platforms but need support in analyzing it to figure out what types of content to offer, which instructors to work with, and how to make courses more accessible and appealing to learners.

The questions that guided this project include:

* What types of courses exist across different categories and subcategories?
* How many courses are there in each category?
* What does viewer engagement look like across categories, subcategories, and languages?
* Which skills are being taught the most in each category?
* What are the most common languages in which courses are offered?
* Which languages are preferred by viewers, especially in the top 5 categories?
* Do subtitles have any noticeable effect on viewership?
* Which instructors consistently receive the best ratings?
* Does course duration affect how many views a course gets?
* Does a higher number of skills in a course lead to more engagement?

## Key Insights Presented in the Dashboard

### Category and Subcategory Analysis

The dashboard shows the number of courses offered in each category and subcategory, helping identify where content is dense or lacking. It also breaks down course types within each category to uncover strategic gaps or opportunities.

### Viewer Engagement

Average views are calculated by category, subcategory, and language. This allows the business to identify which segments drive the most interest and what learners are spending their time on.

### Top Skills Taught

The analysis reveals the most commonly taught skills within each category. This helps align future course development with real-world demand and industry trends.

### Language Distribution

A visual representation of the different languages used across all courses shows how multilingual the content offering currently is.

### Language Preferences

Focusing on the top five categories (based on total views), this part of the dashboard shows which languages are most preferred by learners. This is valuable for improving accessibility and content strategy.

### Subtitles and Viewer Engagement

By comparing courses with and without subtitles, the dashboard explores whether providing subtitle options helps increase viewership.

### Top Instructors

For every category and subcategory, the top three instructors are identified based on average ratings. This helps the business identify high-quality educators they might want to partner with. This insight is shown as a static visual.

### Course Duration and Views

This section investigates whether course length has any effect on engagement. Assumptions were made to standardize durations â€” for example, courses listed by month were calculated using 60 hours per month, and flexible-schedule courses were capped at 200 hours.

### Skill Variety and Viewership

This part looks at whether having a wide variety of skills in a course correlates with higher views. The insight is broken down by category and subcategory.
